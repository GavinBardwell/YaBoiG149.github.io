      <section class = "About">
        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am currently pursuing my Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering with a 
        minor in both Mathematics and Physics at Texas A&M University. I am part of the Corps of Cadets 
        where I am in Squadron 11, violinist in the Texas A&M Philharmonic, and undergraduate researcher. 
        I want to be able to increase my knowledge about computersâ€™ interactions with the world, 
        natural and human, as well figure out solutions to make computers more reliable in adverse conditions. 
        In my free time I enjoy backpacking, running, reading, anime, and diving into hyperpop!</p>
