      <!--About me-->
      <h2>About Me:</h2>
      <p>I am currently pursuing my Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering with a minor in both Mathematics and Physics at Texas A&M University. I am part of the Corps of Cadets where I am in Squadron 11, violinist in the Texas A&M Philharmonic, and undergraduate researcher. I want to be able to increase my knowledge about computersâ€™ interactions with the world, natural and human, as well figure out solutions to make computers more reliable in adverse conditions. In my past time I enjoy backpacking, running, reading science fiction, anime, and diving into hyperpop!</p>
