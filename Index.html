        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">I am currently pursuing my Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering with a 
        minor in both Mathematics and Physics at Texas A&M University. I am part of the Corps of Cadets 
        where I am in Squadron 11, violinist in the Texas A&M Philharmonic, and undergraduate researcher. 
        I want to be able to increase my knowledge about computer's interactions with the world, 
        natural and human, as well figure out solutions to make computers more reliable in adverse conditions. 
        In my free time I enjoy backpacking, running, reading, anime, and diving into hyperpop!</p>

      <h2>Interests</h2>
      <p>I am interested in researching more into semiconductor manufacturing and design, future energy sources, as well as computer optmization. Additionally I love reading more about
       the aerospace industry and physics. I have assisted labs into research and hope to continue the trend and collaborate to help publish academic papers.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
      In my freetime I enjoy being outdoors, playing violin, video games, and reading. I have done many backpacking trips and amazing hiking trips across the nation. 
      
      I enjoy playing music on violin that challenges me and pushes me to learn and grow. This has led to my interests in music like hyperpop and jpop. I enjoy Overwatch, Valorant, and any strategy games.

      As well as that I enjoy reading science fiction novels.
      I love seeing different visions of the future authors create as well the exploration of different beliefs that science fiction tends to. Some notable books and series that I have read and enjoyed is the Dune anthonology by Frank Herbert, the Hyperion Cantos by Dan Simmons, Ender's Game series by Orson Scott created,
      and Remembrance of Earth's Past series by Liu Cixin.
